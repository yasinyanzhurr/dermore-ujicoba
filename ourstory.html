            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>
                Where science interprets nature to support skin health beyond the visible.
            </p>

       INTRO STORY
  ========================= -->
    <section class="content fade-section">
        <h2>Beyond the Surface</h2>
        <p>
            Most skincare stops at what can be seen.
            Dermoree began with a different question:
            what if long-term skin quality is shaped not only at the surface,
            but within the deeper biological environment of the skin itself,
            an environment informed by the balance and intelligence
            found throughout natural biodiversity?
        </p>
        <p>
            This perspective became the foundation of Dermoree,
            a belief that visible skin health reflects the condition
            of processes taking place beneath it,
            where nature’s principles and dermal science quietly converge.
        </p>

        <div>
            <h3>From Dermal Science to the Cellular Environment</h3>
            <p>
                Guided by dermal science, we recognize that the skin functions
                as a complex, interconnected system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Barrier integrity, hydration balance,
                and skin resilience are influenced not only by surface care,
                but by the environment that supports cellular interaction over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rather than targeting isolated concerns,
                Dermoree is developed to support skin function as a whole
                from the outer layers to the cellular environment
                where long-term skin quality is shaped.
            </p>

       INGREDIENT PHILOSOPHY

    <section class="image-text fade-section">
        <div>
            <h3>A Philosophy of Support, Not Intervention</h3>
            <p>
                Dermoree is inspired by the principles of modern dermal science.
                Minimalism with purpose, formulation with intent,
                and an unwavering respect for the biological balance of skin.
            </p>
            <p>
                This means supporting the skin’s innate processes,
                not forcing instant cosmetic transformation,
                but creating conditions where the skin can function optimally
                with consistency.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Each formulation is crafted through human-based observation, prioritizing authentic skin responses over temporary or instant effects.
