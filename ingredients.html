      <h1>The Science Behind Dermoree</h1>
      <p>
        Advanced bioactive ingredients inspired by Japanese innovation, selected through science and natural
        biodiversity.

  <!-- =========================
     INTRODUCTION
========================= -->
  <section class="content fade-section">
    <h2>Where Science Meets Nature</h2>
    <p>
      Dermoree is formulated through a science-first lens guided
      by contemporary skin biology, regenerative research,
      and a deep respect for naturally occurring bioactive systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than following trends,
      we study how different compounds interact with the skin’s environment
      and select those that complement its natural balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each ingredient is chosen for its functional role
      in supporting skin condition, resilience,
      and long-term comfort.
    </p>

  <!-- =========================
     FORMULATION PHILOSOPHY
========================= -->
  <section class="content fade-section">
    <h2>A Thoughtful Combination</h2>
    <p>
      Dermoree’s formulation is built on purposeful synergy.
      Each component is selected not for immediate effect,
      but for how it contributes to overall skin condition
      when used consistently over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing excessive. Nothing impulsive.
      Only what is relevant, intentional,
      and beneficial to the skin.
    </p>

      <div class="ingredient-text">
        <h3>Centella Exosome (Japan)</h3>
        <p>
          An advanced bioactive delivery system derived from Centella asiatica,
          reflecting a modern approach to ingredient delivery
          inspired by Japanese skin science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through next-generation exosome technology,
          the essence of Centella is designed to support
          the deeper skin environment,
          helping maintain comfort, balance,
          and resilience over time.
        </p>

      <div class="ingredient-text">
        <h3>Salmon DNA (PDRN-Inspired)</h3>
        <p>
          Inspired by regenerative dermatology, Salmon DNA is a bioactive component recognized
          for its role in supporting skin renewal and recovery at a structural level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drawing from PDRN-inspired research, this ingredient helps encourage skin resilience
          by supporting the natural repair environment within the skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          With consistent use, Salmon DNA contributes to improved skin smoothness,
          enhanced elasticity, and a healthier-looking appearance over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than offering instant cosmetic correction, it supports gradual skin improvement
          aligned with the skin’s natural renewal cycle.

        <h3>Fermented Honey</h3>
        <p>
          Through a natural fermentation process, honey becomes enriched with bioavailable compounds
          that support a healthy and balanced skin microbiome.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fermentation enhances the functional properties of honey,
          allowing beneficial components to interact more effectively with the skin environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          A well-supported microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining skin comfort,
          hydration balance, and barrier integrity.
        </p>
        <p>
          By helping preserve microbial harmony on the skin surface,
          fermented honey contributes to a calmer, more resilient,
          and well-conditioned appearance over time.
