      <h1>The Science Behind Dermoree</h1>
      <p>
        Advanced bioactive ingredients inspired by Japanese innovation, selected through science and natural
        biodiversity.

     INTRODUCTION
========================= -->
  <section class="content fade-section">
    <h2>Where Science Meets Nature</h2>
    <p>
      Dermoree is formulated through a science-first lens guided
      by contemporary skin biology, regenerative research,
      and a deep respect for naturally occurring bioactive systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than following trends,
      we study how different compounds interact with the skin’s environment
      and select those that complement its natural balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each ingredient is chosen for its functional role
      in supporting skin condition, resilience,
      and long-term comfort.
    </p>

  <!-- =========================
     FORMULATION PHILOSOPHY
========================= -->
  <section class="content fade-section">
    <h2>A Thoughtful Combination</h2>
    <p>
      Dermoree’s formulation is built on purposeful synergy.
      Each component is selected not for immediate effect,
      but for how it contributes to overall skin condition
      when used consistently over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing excessive. Nothing impulsive.
      Only what is relevant, intentional,
      and beneficial to the skin.
    </p>
